# Landmark Quiz
A simple program that takes a Google Sheet with config settings and filtered worksheets (for questions and responses) and creates a multi-page quiz.

Each question shows text and an image next to an interactive map allowing the participant to click where on the map they think the picture was taken.

To make edits to the content, please update the 'config' and 'question' worksheets in the 'landmarks_quiz' Google Sheet.
